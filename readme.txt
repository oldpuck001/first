This Python script creates a text editor with additional features, such as exporting to PDF and text-to-speech functionality. It uses libraries like tkinter for the user interface, reportlab for PDF exporting, and azure.cognitiveservices.speech for the text-to-speech conversion.
First, the necessary libraries are imported. The mainFilePath is defined as a global variable to keep track of the current file path.
The script then defines functions for various text editing and file operation tasks:
mainNewFile(): Opens a new file. If the current file has unsaved changes, it will prompt the user to save.
mainOpenFile(): Opens an existing file after prompting the user to save unsaved changes.
mainSaveFile(): Saves the current file.
mainSaveAsFile(): Saves the current file with a new name and location.
mainExportAsPDF(): Exports the current file as a PDF.
mainUndoText(), mainRedoText(), mainCutText(), mainCopyText(), mainPasteText(): Undo, redo, cut, copy, and paste text functions.
mainRead(): Converts selected text into speech using Azure's Speech Service.
mainCaption(): Adjusts the current text for better presentation in a speech synthesizer.
TextToTextMP3(): Converts text to MP3 file using Azure's Speech Service.
A GUI is then created using tkinter, with menus for file operations (new, open, save, save as, export as PDF) and editing commands (undo, redo, cut, copy, paste, read, caption). Shortcuts are provided for these operations.
A word count is also included, which updates every second.
Finally, when the user attempts to close the program, mainCloseWindow() checks if there are any unsaved changes and prompts the user to save if there are. The mainWindow.mainloop() function is called to start the GUI event loop.
